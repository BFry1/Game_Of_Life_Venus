# Venus_Game_of_Life
This repository contains the work carried out on the Venus Game of Life simulation, a MSc project investigating the feasibility of life in the clouds of Venus. The files in this repository are the simulations and code produced as part of the project.

The simulations are contained within the folders. The simulations were created in triples with three speeds available for viewing, the fast, medium and slow speeds. The folders also contain all of the .png files which were used in the creation of the .gifs.
